# FreeCodeCamp.com Bonfire Coding Challenges
### Exercises in Javascript algorithms

A record of Charles Morgan's solutions to the **Intermediate & Advanced** Algorithm Scripting challenges that populate the Frontend Development section of the [FreeCodeCamp.com](http://freecodecamp.com) online curriculum (**AKA** *Bonfires*).

I decided to post these for several reasons, the most important of which being:
  1. Demonstration of my progression from algorithm/js n00biocrity, to algorithms/js novice.
  2. The need to review my work, my solutions, and my overall coding style/ability.
  3. Refreshing my knowledge of basic algorithms.
  4. To help provide a reference for other FCC students that may need it.
  5. To leverage my increased understanding and skill to refactor, rewrite, and add new solutions to older problems.

I hope that you find these solutions to be either helpful, or informative. Even if they inform you on what NOT to do when writing algorithms in Javascript ;-)

Thanks for dropping by,
